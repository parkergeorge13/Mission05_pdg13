<p>
    I'm excited to learn ASP.Net in IS 413! It will be my first strongly typed language which I think adds one of the finishing touches I'm looking for to complete my resume.
    During this semester I hope to learn more about the intricacies of web development. I have started a web development business and feel like more training could be critical
    to this venture's success.
